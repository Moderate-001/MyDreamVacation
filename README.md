# My_Dream_Vacation_Webpage
College Assignment : 
This is my first website project, created using HTML, and it showcases my dream vacation destination. The website describes where I would love to travel, what I’d do there, and why it’s my dream place to visit. The main purpose of this project is to practice basic web development skills and express creativity through content and design. It helped me understand how a webpage is structured and how to present information in a clean and engaging way.
